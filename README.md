In late 2019, a new virus called Covid-19 hit the globe. As a result, most of the world was shut down for extended periods of time including stores, schools, airports ... etc,. After a couple of months, vaccines were successfully developed and distributed. In this project, we aim to develop a system that keeps the records of the people who are taking the vaccines to determine the people's status (vaccinated, fully vaccinated, and whether a given individual is vaccinated or not).
